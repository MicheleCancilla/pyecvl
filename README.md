[![Build Status](https://jenkins-master-deephealth-unix01.ing.unimore.it/badge/job/DeepHealth/job/pyecvl/job/master/linux_end?)](https://jenkins-master-deephealth-unix01.ing.unimore.it/job/DeepHealth/job/pyecvl/job/master/)

**PyECVL** is a Python wrapper for [ECVL](https://github.com/deephealthproject/ecvl), the European Computer Vision Library.


Each PyECVL version requires a specific ECVL version. If you are installing
PyECVL with EDDL support (on by default), you also need to install
[PyEDDL](https://github.com/deephealthproject/pyeddl). The following table
shows the required ECVL and PyEDDL versions for each PyECVL version:

PyECVL version | ECVL version | PyEDDL version |
-------------- | ------------ | -------------- |
0.1.0          | 0.1.0        | 0.1.0          |


## Quick start

The following assumes you have ECVL already installed in "standard"
system paths (e.g., `/usr/local/include`, `/usr/local/lib`).

    python3 -m pip install numpy pybind11 pytest
    python3 -m pip install pyeddl==0.1.0
    python3 -m pip install pyecvl==0.1.0

See [full installation instructions below](#installation).


## Getting started

```python
import numpy as np
import pyecvl.ecvl as ecvl

def inc_brightness(img, rate):
    a = np.array(img, copy=False)
    max_val = np.iinfo(a.dtype).max
    a[a > max_val - rate] = max_val
    a[a <= max_val - rate] += rate

def main():
    img = ecvl.ImRead("test.jpg")
    inc_brightness(img, 10)
    ecvl.ImWrite("test_mod.jpg", img)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```


## Installation

### Requirements

- Python 3
- ECVL
- NumPy
- pybind11
- pyeddl (not needed if building with `ECVL_EDDL` set to `OFF`)
- pytest (if you want to run the tests)


### ECVL Installation

Complete ECVL installation instructions are available at
https://github.com/deephealthproject/ecvl. Here is a sample build sequence:

```
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/deephealthproject/pyecvl.git
cd third_party/ecvl
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DECVL_WITH_DICOM=ON -DECVL_WITH_OPENSLIDE=ON -DECVL_DATASET=ON -DECVL_BUILD_EDDL=ON ..
make
make install
```


### PyECVL installation

Install requirements:

```
python3 -m pip install numpy pybind11 pytest

```

Install PyECVL:

```
python3 -m pip install pyecvl
```

Or, from the pyecvl git repository:

```
python3 setup.py install
```

Then, you can test your installation by running the tests. From the pyecvl git
repository:

    pytest tests

If you are installing with EDDL support (on by default), you also need to
install a specific version of pyeddl (see the table above). For instance:

```
python3 -m pip install pyecvl==0.1.0
```


### Disabling unwanted modules

By default, PyECVL assumes a complete ECVL installation, including optional
modules (except for the GUI), and builds bindings for all of them. You can
disable support for specific modules via environment variables. For instance,
suppose you installed ECVL without openslide support: by default, PyECVL will
try to build the bindings for openslide-specific ECVL tools and link the
openslide library, which might not even be present on your system. To avoid
this, set the `ECVL_WITH_OPENSLIDE` environment variable to `OFF` (or `FALSE`)
before building PyECVL. Similarly, you can turn off DICOM and EDDL support by
setting `ECVL_WITH_DICOM` and `ECVL_EDDL` to `OFF`.


### ECVL installed in an arbitrary directory

The above installation instructions assume ECVL has been installed in standard
system paths. However, ECVL can be installed in an arbitrary directory,
for instance:

```
cd third_party/ecvl
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/home/myuser/ecvl -DECVL_WITH_DICOM=ON -DECVL_WITH_OPENSLIDE=ON -DECVL_DATASET=ON -DECVL_BUILD_EDDL=ON ..
make
make install
```

You can tell the PyECVL setup script about this via the `ECVL_DIR` environment
variable:

```
export ECVL_DIR=/home/myuser/ecvl
python3 setup.py install
```

In this way, `setup.py` will look for additional include files in
`/home/myuser/ecvl/include` and for additional libraries in
`/home/myuser/ecvl/lib`.

Similarly, if EDDL is installed in an arbitrary path, you can tell the setup
script via the `EDDL_DIR` environment variable.
